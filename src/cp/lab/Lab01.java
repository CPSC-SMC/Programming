/**
 * In this lab, you will become familiar with NetBeans, the Java console, and 
 * printing to the Java console. You will also learn how to send me your
 * assignments.
 * 
 * CPSC 207: Computer Programming
 * Lab 1: Getting to know NetBeans, Java and printing to the Java Console
 * 
 * 1. Open NetBeans.
 * 
 * 2. Create a NetBeans project. (File>New Project...).
 *      a. Choose Java from the list on the left.
 *      b. Choose Java Application on the right.  Click next.
 *      c. Change the project name to Lab01.
 *      d. Create your project in the My Documents-> NetBeansProjects folder.
 *      e. Click finish.
 * 
 * 3. Wait a little bit. The program should create and open a file called 
 * Lab01.java.
 * 
 * 4. Replace everything that is in your Lab01.java file with this file.
 * 
 * 5. Look to see if there are any problems. These would be underline with a red
 * squiggle. Look especially at line 7 above.
 * 
 * 6. If you find such a problem, click on the appropriate line of code.
 *      a. NetBeans may show you a red light bulb in the margin.
 *      b. Click the red light bulb. It presents you with options. In the case
 *      of line 7, select "Change package declaration to [...] ..."
 *      c. It changes the code automatically.
 * 
 * 7. Find public static void main(String [] args). This is your "main method".
 * The main method is where the main code for the program goes.
 * 
 * 8. Find and delete // TODO code application logic here. At the end of that 
 * line, press the enter key to obtain a new line.
 * 
 * 9. Write 3 lines of code (use the println method) that print three separate 
 * personal goals for you in this class. You are welcome to refer to the 
 * syllabus to recall what sorts of learning goals to anticipate.
 * 
 * 10. Add several comments (notes to yourself) in your code using //
 * 
 * 11. Build and run your project using the green "play" button on the NetBeans
 * toolbar.
 * 
 * 12. Examine the text output of your program. It will appear in a text area 
 * below the code. This is called the Java Console. Does the program do what you
 * expected?
 * 
 * 13. Create documentation for your project. 
 *      a. Add a description of your program after the * on line 88. For
 *      example, you could type "This is our first Java lab. Iâ€™m almost finished."
 *      b. Select Run->Generate Javadoc (...) from the menu in NetBeans. This 
 *      will open a web browser window with your Javadoc in it. Find the lab
 *      description and the text that you typed.
 * 
 * 14. Prepare your Google Drive. (One time only)
 *      a. Login to <a href="https://drive.google.com">drive.google.com</a>.
 *      with your Saint Mary's email and password.
 *      b. If you have not done so, activate Google drive.
 *      c. Create a folder that uses your first initial, last 
 *      name and the course number. For example AJones207. Today and in the
 *      future, you will put your project in this folder so I can see it.
 *      d. Share this folder with me. This will ensure that I can see all of the
 *      work you send to me.
 * 
 * 15. Upload your project folder to Google Drive. Use the button that looks
 * like an upward arrow on top of a line.
 *      a. Select Folder...
 *      b. Find My Documents-> NetBeansProjects.
 *      c. Select the Lab01 folder.
