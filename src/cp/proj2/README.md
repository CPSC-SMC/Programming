Program 2: Your first mash-up

A mash-up in web service programming is a program that combines information from 
multiple web services to create a more interesting or immersive user experience. 
For example, simply asking for a zip code and receiving a city and state is 
useful, but unlikely to cause the user to continue using the program. On the 
other hand, a program that helps you plan travel and get weather information
about your destination is going to be more helpful.

Design and write a program that uses a user-entered address or location to 
produce a weather report and driving directions from Saint Mary's to that place. 
If the zip code in question is for your home state, print *** after the city name 
to let everyone know how excited you are! The report should include weather 
information of your choice for the city. The user should be able to 
continue entering zip codes (without restarting the program) until she wants to 
quit.

Here are some hints: 

1. You'll need an if statement to check if the state of the zip code is your home state.
2. You'll need a big loop that allows all of these items to be repeated.
3. You might want to use your Weather class from Lab 4.
