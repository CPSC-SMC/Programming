/**
 * <p>Lab 11: Mashup II Directions and Knowledge</p>
 * <p>CPSC 207: Computer Programming</p>
 * 
 * <p>Make a GUI program that computes directions from an origin to a 
 * destination. Also provide some kind of information about the origin and 
 * destination using the WolframAlpha web service and optionally other web 
 * services of your choice.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Also begin thinking about how to design your final project.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Set up your package and get your GUI started.</p>
 * 
 * <ol><li>Review the Directions documentation: <br/>
 * http://sites.saintmarys.edu/~sbroad/javadoc/edu/saintmarys/google/Directions.html<br/>
 * The method you want to use is Directions.stepByStep() which produces step by 
 * step directions in HTML format. This information should go into a JEditorPane 
 * component. The JEditorPane component should be on a JScrollPane.
 * 
 * <li>In addition to the directions, your program will use the WolframAlpha web 
 * service to retrieve information about the Destination. Check out 
 * http://sites.saintmarys.edu/~sbroad/javadoc/edu/saintmarys/wolfram/WolframAlpha.html</li>
 * 
 * <li>Draw a picture of what your GUI will look like.</li>
 * 
 * <li>Create a Java Application project. Replace the text in the class file 
 * that it creates with the text in this file.</li>
 * 
 * <li>Add a JFrame form.</li>
 * 
 * <li>Layout your GUI.</li>
 * 
 * <li>Create event handling methods for the relevant components.</li>
 * 
 * <li>Implement those methods to get information from Google Directions and 
 * WolframAlpha and display that info in the relevant components.</li>
 * 
 * <li>Draw a picture of a GUI for a possible final project.</li></ol>
 * 
 * For your final project you will choose a GUI program to make and use web 
 * services of your choice to access it. Please consult your instructor for 
 * advice, etc.
 * 
 * Please browse http://sites.saintmarys.edu/~sbroad/javadoc/index.html?overview-summary.html 
 * and follow the links to discover other web services that we have not yet used.
