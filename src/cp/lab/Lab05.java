/**
 * CPSC 207: Computer Programming
 * Lab 5: Twitter Queries and Loops
 * 
 * In this program, the user will enter Twitter queries. The program will print 
 * the all Tweets that satisfy the search criteria. Each tweet printed should 
 * include the date and time of the tweet, the tweet text and the number of 
 * characters in the tweet. The program should ask if the user has more 
 * searches to request. If so, the program should continue requesting queries 
 * and usernames. Otherwise, the program should exit after giving a farewell 
 * message.
 * 
 * 1. Create a Lab05 project.
 * 
 * 2. You will need to add the twitter4j-core-3.0.3.jar to the libraries for
 * the project. This is available from the Java Jar files folder in Blackboard.
 * Add this .jar file to your Project as usual.
 * 
 * 3. Download and save 
 * https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B_i1NxACvw9yMERrMFoyQnBIMTQ/edit?usp=sharing
 * in the Lab5/src folder. Make sure that it shows up in your project browser in 
 * NetBeans.
 * 
 * 4. You can do all of your work in Lab05.java.
 * 
 * 5. This lab involves two loops. The outer loop will continue looping as long 
 * as the user says "yes" when prompted if they want to continue. Each time 
 * through the loop, the program will prompt the user for a search, then run the
 * search and print the results.
 * 
 * 6. One loop will be "inside" the other. This inner loop is where the search 
 * results are printed. The inner loop is the one shown in the example mentioned 
 * below. Review example #4: http://twitter4j.org/en/code-examples.html
 * 
 * 7. To determine if two strings are the same, you should use either the 
 * equals() method as in section 5.3 or the equalsIgnoreCase() method which is 
 * very similar.
 * 
 * 8. Complete and generate your javadoc.
 * 
 * 9. Submit your project.
