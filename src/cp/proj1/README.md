Program 1

Make a program that asks the user for her first and last names, zip code, and 
birthdate. In response, the program should prepare a little report in the Java 
console that includes the following:

1. A welcome message which uses the user's full first name and the first initial 
of her last name.
2. Her age.
3. Her location.

You will need the java.util.Date and java.text.SimpleDateFormat classes. See the 
how to document (http://goo.gl/4zSlM).

Also see the documentation pages:

You will also need the SimpleZip web service.
