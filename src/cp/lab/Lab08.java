 * <p>Lab 8: Drawing in Java</p>
 * <p>CPSC 207: Computer Programming</p>
 * 
 * <p>If it is Fall semester, make a Java applet in which you draw a turkey and 
 * add the text Happy Thanksgiving!</p>
 * 
 * <p>If it is Spring semester, make a Java applet in which you draw a bunny and
 * add the text Happy Easter!</p>
 * 
 * <ol><li>Choose an image (possibly from a Google search) of a turkey to use as 
 * a model.</li>
 * 
 * <li>Create a new project. Copy this file over the text in Lab08.java.</li>
 * 
 * <li>Make sure that the class Lab08 extends JApplet. (Why?)</li>
 * 
 * <li>Declare a public void paint(Graphics page) method in the Lab8 class.</li>
 * 
 * <li>Implement the code that paints your picture. You may want to use the 
 * JPolyDraw applet to help you draw polygons. http://sites.saintmarys.edu/~sbroad/jPolyDraw/</li>
 * 
 * <li>Publish your applet to your Saint Mary’s web page.</li><ol type="a">
 * 
 * <li>Publish your site: Visit http://sites.saintmarys.edu/ and follow 
 * instructions to publish your page.</li>
 * 
 * <li>Look in My Documents for the NetBeansProjects folder. In that folder, 
 * find Lab08. In Lab08, find the build folder. Copy everything in the build 
 * folder into H:\WWW\. )</li>
 * 
 * <li>Now visit http://sites.saintmarys.edu/~<username>/Lab08.html</li></ol>
 * 
 * <li>If the Turkey or Bunny doesn’t show up completely, open notepad and edit 
 * H:\WWW\Lab08.html.  About two thirds of the way down, you’ll see &lt;applet&gt;. 
 * Just change the width and height until you can see the whole turkey!</li>
 * 
 * <li>Submit your project. Email the instructor a link to your Turkey or Bunny</li></ol>
