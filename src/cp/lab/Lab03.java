/**
 * CPSC 207: Computer Programming
 * Lab 3: Typecasting, formatting, variable operations
 * 
 * In this lab, we will explore various types of variables and operations we 
 * can do with them. In particular, we will learn how to produce formatted text 
 * reports.
 * 
 * 1. Create a new project in NetBeans. Copy this file over the contents.
 * 
 * 2. In the main method,
 *      a. prompt for and scan in user’s first name
 *      b. prompt for and scan in user’s last name
 *      c. prompt for and scan in user’s age in days (don’t know? try 
 *      www.wolframalpha.com enter "how many days since ________" and put your 
 *      birthday in the blank)
 *      d. calculate the user’s initials, (check out substring in section 3.1)
 *      e. calculate the user’s age in years (printable to three decimal places, 
 *      assuming 365.25 days per year) (check out section 2.5)
 *      f. print a short report including the user’s name, initials, age in 
 *      years to three decimal places. (We will use the printf method described 
 *      in section 3.6.)
 *      g. Make sure that your report indicates that the ages calculated are 
 *      approximate.
 * 
 * 3. Test your project.
 *      a. Try several valid inputs. Are the approximations good?
 *      b. Try entering something that is not a number when prompted for the 
 *      number of days old. What happens?
 * 
 * 4. Submit your program. Upload the project folder to your assignments folder
 * in Google Drive.
