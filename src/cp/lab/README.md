CPSC 207: Computer Programming
Lab Activities

This folder contains instructions for all of the lab activities that we will do
this semester. For each lab, please create a NetBeans project with the relevant
name. Replace the text in the main file that it produces automatically with the
text in the relevant file above. Then follow the instructions provided in the 
file. Please ignore any <li>, <ol>, <br/>, </li>, </ol>. These are only for
formatting the text so that it looks good in Java documentation.
