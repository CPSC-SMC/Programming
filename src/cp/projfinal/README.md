Final Project

Your final project is a program of your choosing. It needs to be substantial 
using some (but not all of the ideas covered this semester). It will probably 
involve at least two .java files (possibly more if it makes sense).  Here is an 
outline of the process.

1. Choose your project. (The instructor is happy to help with this.)
2. Identify your user requirements. (A numbered list of things the program 
should do if it works.)
3. Use at least one web service of your choosing.

Post all document, image files and code files to this assignment in Blackboard. 
Make sure that all image files and necessary Java libraries are included in the 
.jar file that you submit.

Complete a Design document as per the template we used earlier in the semester.
