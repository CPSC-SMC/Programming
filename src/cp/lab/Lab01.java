/**
 * <p>Lab 1: Getting to know NetBeans, Java and printing to the Java Console</p>
 * <p>CPSC 207: Computer Programming</p>
 * 
 * <p>In this lab, you will become familiar with NetBeans, the Java console, and 
 * printing to the Java console. You will also learn how to send me your
 * assignments.</p>
 * 
 * <ol><li> Open NetBeans.</li>
 * 
 * <li> Create a NetBeans project. (File>New Project...).<ol type="a">
 *      <li> Choose Java from the list on the left.</li>
 *      <li> Choose Java Application on the right.  Click next.</li>
 *      <li> Change the project name to Lab01.</li>
 *      <li> Create your project in the My Documents-> NetBeansProjects folder.</li>
 *      <li> Click finish.</li></ol></li>
 * 
 * <li> Wait a little bit. The program should create and open a file called 
 * Lab01.java.</li>
 * 
 * <li>4. Replace everything that is in your Lab01.java file with this file.</li>
 * 
 * <li> Look to see if there are any problems. These would be underline with a red
 * squiggle. Look especially at line 7 above.</li>
 * 
 * <li> If you find such a problem, click on the appropriate line of code.<ol>
 *      <li> NetBeans may show you a red light bulb in the margin.</li>
 *      <li> Click the red light bulb. It presents you with options. In the case
 *      of line 7, select "Change package declaration to [...] ..."</li>
 *      <li> It changes the code automatically.</li></ol></li>
 * 
 * <li> Find public static void main(String [] args). This is your "main method".
 * The main method is where the main code for the program goes.</li>
 * 
 * <li> Find and delete // TODO code application logic here. At the end of that 
 * line, press the enter key to obtain a new line.</li>
 * 
 * <li> Write 3 lines of code (use the println method) that print three separate 
 * personal goals for you in this class. You are welcome to refer to the 
 * syllabus to recall what sorts of learning goals to anticipate.</li>
 * 
 * <li> Add several comments (notes to yourself) in your code using //</li>
 * 
 * <li> Build and run your project using the green "play" button on the NetBeans
 * toolbar.</li>
 * 
 * <li> Examine the text output of your program. It will appear in a text area 
 * below the code. This is called the Java Console. Does the program do what you
 * expected?</li>
 * 
 * <li> Create documentation for your project. <ol>
 *      <li> Add a description of your program after the * on line 88. For
 *      example, you could type "This is our first Java lab. Iâ€™m almost finished."</li>
 *      <li> Select Run->Generate Javadoc (...) from the menu in NetBeans. This 
 *      will open a web browser window with your Javadoc in it. Find the lab
 *      description and the text that you typed.</li></ol></li>
 * 
 * <li> Complete the lab by completing the Lab 1 assignment in Blackboard. If 
 * you need help finding the .java file to upload, please ask your instructor or
 * lab assistant. It should be in the "My Documents/NetBeansProjects/Lab01/src"
 * folder.
 * </li>
