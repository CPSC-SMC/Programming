/**
 * <p>Lab 3: Typecasting, formatting, variable operations</p>
 * <p>CPSC 207: Computer Programming</p>
 * 
 * <p>In this lab, we will explore various types of variables and operations we 
 * can do with them. In particular, we will learn how to produce formatted text 
 * reports.</p>
 * 
 * <ol><li> Create a new project in NetBeans. Copy this file over the contents.</li>
 * 
 * <li> In the main method,</li><ol>
 *      <li> prompt for and scan in user’s first name</li>
 *      <li> prompt for and scan in user’s last name</li>
 *      <li>prompt for and scan in user’s age in days (don’t know? try 
 *      www.wolframalpha.com enter "how many days since ________" and put your 
 *      birthday in the blank)</li>
 *      <li>calculate the user’s initials, (check out substring in section 3.1)</li>
 *      <li>calculate the user’s age in years (printable to three decimal places, 
 *      assuming 365.25 days per year) (check out section 2.5)</li>
 *      <li>print a short report including the user’s name, initials, age in 
 *      years to three decimal places. (We will use the printf method described 
 *      in section 3.6.)</li>
 *      <li>Make sure that your report indicates that the ages calculated are 
 *      approximate.</li></ol>
 * 
 * <li> Test your project.</li><ol>
 *      <li> Try several valid inputs. Are the approximations good?</li>
 *      <li> Try entering something that is not a number when prompted for the 
 *      number of days old. What happens?</li></ol>
 * 
 * <li> Submit your program. Upload the project folder to your assignments folder
 * in Google Drive.</li></ol>
