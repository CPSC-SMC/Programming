Programming
===========

This repository contains code examples and assignment files for
CPSC 207 (Computer Programming). These files are set up as one
large project that you can use throughout the semester.

Please refer to assignments listed in Blackboard to understand
which files you need to use as part of your assignment, and
which you should leave alone.

From here, most of what will interest students is in the "src"
folder, which you can click above to browse. You'll want to
continue browsing down from there.
